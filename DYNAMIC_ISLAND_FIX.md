# Dynamic Island Fix for Local Hero App

## Problem
The app had issues with Dynamic Island on newer iPhone models where headers and titles were not properly positioned, causing large gaps between the status bar and app content.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Added SafeAreaProvider** to the root App.tsx
2. **Replaced hardcoded paddingTop** with dynamic `useSafeAreaInsets()` hook
3. **Wrapped all screens** with `SafeAreaView` and proper edge handling
4. **Used `edges={[]}`** to prevent white gaps while maintaining safe area awareness

## Files Modified
- `App.tsx` - Added SafeAreaProvider wrapper
- `HomeScreen.tsx` - Added SafeAreaView and useSafeAreaInsets
- `InboxScreen.tsx` - Added SafeAreaView and useSafeAreaInsets  
- `PostScreen.tsx` - Added SafeAreaView and useSafeAreaInsets
- `NameInputScreen.tsx` - Added SafeAreaView and useSafeAreaInsets
- `ProfileScreen.tsx` - Added SafeAreaView and useSafeAreaInsets

## How It Works
- `SafeAreaProvider` provides safe area context to the entire app
- `useSafeAreaInsets()` hook returns dynamic insets for top, bottom, left, right
- `SafeAreaView` with `edges={[]}` handles safe areas without creating white gaps
- Dynamic padding calculation: `paddingTop: insets.top + 16`
- Headers now extend to the top edge while respecting safe area insets

## Benefits
- ✅ Properly handles Dynamic Island on iPhone 14 Pro/Pro Max
- ✅ Works with all device notches and safe areas
- ✅ Responsive to device orientation changes
- ✅ No more hardcoded padding values
- ✅ No white gaps between status bar and headers
- ✅ Consistent dark blue header background across all screens
- ✅ Consistent across all screens

## Testing
Test on devices with:
- Dynamic Island (iPhone 14 Pro/Pro Max)
- Notch (iPhone X and newer)
- No notch (iPhone 8 and older)

The app should now display headers and content properly positioned with no white gaps, regardless of the device's safe area configuration.
